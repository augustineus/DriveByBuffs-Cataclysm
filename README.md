# DriveByBuffs
An RP Addon for World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic to thank players for "drive by" buffs.

When you're running through the Barrens and get a MoTW, you'll automatically emote positively at the buffer.

Currently, the emote list consists of the following pieces: local emotes = {"is amazed by ", "blushes at ", "bows before ", "cheers for ", "claps for ", "is happy with ", "hugs ", "blows a kiss at ", "salutes ", "thanks ", "cuddles up to ", "highly praises ", "gives many commendations to ", "flirts with "}

These pieces will come out as "{playerName} bows before {bufferName} for their {approvedBuffName}".

The current list of approved buffs are: local validBuffs = {"Arcane Intellect", "Arcane Brilliance", "Focus Magic", "Power Word: Fortitude", "Mark of the Wild", "Blessing of Might", "Blessing of Kings", "Unending Breath",
										"Dark Intent", "Divine Hymn", "Power Infusion", "Thorns", "Innervate", "Tricks of the Trade", "Unholy Frenzy", "Misdirection",
										"Hand of Sacrifice", "Hand of Freedom", "Hand of Protection", "Divine Guardian", "Hand of Salvation"}
